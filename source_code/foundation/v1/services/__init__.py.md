# Foundation Services Module Documentation

[TOC]

## 1. Introduction

This document provides internal code documentation for the `foundation_services` module. This module currently contains a single submodule: `file_system_monitoring`.  The module's primary purpose is to provide foundational services for various application components.


## 2. Module Structure

The `foundation_services` module is structured as follows:

| Component          | Description                                                                     |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `file_system_monitoring` | Provides functionality for monitoring the file system.  (See Section 3 for details) |


## 3.  `file_system_monitoring` Submodule

This submodule (imported from `foundation_services.file_system_monitoring`) is responsible for monitoring file system activity.  Specific functions and their implementations are detailed below.  *(Note:  Since the provided code only shows the module import and not the submodule's content, detailed implementation of its functions cannot be described here.  This section would be expanded upon once the submodule's code is available.)*

While the specific implementation details are unavailable from the provided code snippet, a typical `file_system_monitoring` submodule might include functions for:

* **Monitoring disk space usage:**  This might involve periodically checking disk space and triggering alerts if thresholds are exceeded.  The algorithm would likely involve using operating system calls to retrieve disk usage statistics and comparing them to predefined limits.

* **Tracking file changes:** This could involve techniques like polling (periodically checking for changes in file timestamps or sizes) or using operating system events to detect file system modifications in real time.

* **Generating reports:** This function would aggregate monitoring data and generate reports in suitable formats (e.g., CSV, JSON).


## 4.  Module Exports

The `__all__` variable specifies the public interface of the `foundation_services` module. Currently, only the `file_system_monitoring` submodule is publicly accessible:

```python
__all__ = ["file_system_monitoring"]
```

This means that only `file_system_monitoring` can be imported directly from `foundation_services`.  Other internal components are not exposed.
