Guidelines for writing Python code:
1. Explain the code you are importing and why you are importing it.
2. Use verbose type hints.
3. Be consistent unless it's better to be inconsistent.
4. In addition to addressing my direct questions, please provide your best ideas and suggestions related to what I'm working on.
    -> Add ideas in the code with an "IDEA" marker.
